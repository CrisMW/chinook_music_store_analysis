# An analysis of the Chinook music store database
## Answering business questions with SQL

This project looks into the SQLite database of a fictional music streaming store called Chinook. The goal is to gain insights that can guide future decision making.

Specifically, I will use the data to make decisions in four scenarios:

We have been offered several albums of different genres, but our budget only allows us to purchase some of them. Which one should we buy based on past sales data?
We are introducing a new bonus programm for the best performing sales rep. Who should receive the bonus?
We decide to reduce our costs by focussing on the countries that we are most succesful in. I will use the database to determine which countries we should focus on.
Lastly, we need to decide whether we should focus on offering whole albums or single tracks. I will use our data to compare order volumes for entire albums and single tracks.
